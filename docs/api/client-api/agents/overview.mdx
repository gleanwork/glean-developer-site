# Agents API Overview

The Agents API provides programmatic control over Glean agents, enabling you to build, deploy, and manage AI agents across your organization. This API allows you to integrate Glean's agent capabilities directly into your applications and workflows.

## Key Capabilities

The Agents API enables:

- **Agent Discovery**: Search and retrieve available agents in your deployment
- **Agent Execution**: Create and manage agent runs with streaming or blocking responses
- **Schema Inspection**: Examine agent input and output schemas for integration planning
- **Real-time Integration**: Stream agent responses to chat interfaces and applications
- **External Application Integration**: Embed Glean agents into your existing systems

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [`/agents`](./search-agents.api.mdx) | Search and list available agents |
| [`/agents/{agentId}`](./get-agent.api.mdx) | Get detailed information about a specific agent |
| [`/agents/{agentId}/schemas`](./get-agent-schemas.api.mdx) | Retrieve agent input/output schemas |
| [`/agents/{agentId}/runs`](./create-and-stream-run.api.mdx) | Create streaming agent runs |
| [`/agents/{agentId}/runs`](./create-and-wait-run.api.mdx) | Create blocking agent runs |

## Agent Builder Integration

Agents are created and configured through Glean's Agent Builder interface. The API provides programmatic access to these user-created agents.

### Finding Agent IDs

To use an agent programmatically, you'll need its Agent ID. You can find this in the Agent Builder URL:

![Agent ID in URL](./images/agent-id.png)

The Agent ID appears in the URL path: `/admin/agents/{agentId}`

## Protocol Compatibility

The Agents API implements a subset of the [LangChain Agent Protocol](https://langchain-ai.github.io/agent-protocol/api.html#tag/agents), specifically:

- **[Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/agent-protocol/api.html#tag/agents)**: Agent discovery and metadata
- **[Runs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/agent-protocol/api.html#tag/runs)**: Agent execution and run management

This ensures compatibility with any agent runtime that supports this standard protocol.

## Authentication & Setup

Before using the Agents API, ensure you have:

1. **API Token**: A [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/glean-issued#available-scopes) with `agents` scope
2. **Agent Access**: Permissions to access the agents you want to use
3. **Base URL**: Your organization's Glean instance URL

## Common Integration Patterns

### Streaming Responses
For real-time chat interfaces, use the streaming endpoints to provide immediate feedback:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/agents/agent-123/runs', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    query: 'What is our vacation policy?',
    stream: true 
  })
});

const reader = response.body.getReader();
// Process streaming chunks...
```

### Batch Processing
For bulk operations, use the blocking endpoints to process multiple queries:

```python
import asyncio
from glean.api_client import Glean

async def process_queries(queries):
    with Glean(api_token="your-token", instance="your-org") as client:
        tasks = [
            client.agents.create_and_wait_run(
                agent_id="agent-123", 
                query=query
            ) for query in queries
        ]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## Next Steps

- Browse the [API endpoint documentation](./search-agents.api.mdx) for detailed request/response schemas  
- Check out the [Building Agents guide](/guides/agents/) for different ways to create agent-powered applications
- Review [authentication requirements](/api-info/client/authentication/) for API access
