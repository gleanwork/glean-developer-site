# API Clients

Glean offers official API clients for several popular programming languages to help developers integrate Glean's powerful search and knowledge capabilities into their applications. These clients provide language-specific interfaces to Glean's APIs, making it easier to build custom solutions without having to handle the low-level HTTP requests.

:::info
**Authentication Required**: You'll need API tokens to use these libraries. Get [Client API tokens](/api-info/client/authentication/overview) for search and chat features, or [Indexing API tokens](/api-info/indexing/authentication/overview) for document management.
:::

:::tip
**Unified Libraries**: These API clients support **both Client API and Indexing API** functionality. Use the same library with different tokens depending on whether you're building user-facing features (Client API) or managing document indexing (Indexing API).
