We provide the functionality of filtering the list of possible facets of a particular type (obtained in the [`facetResults`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!c=200&path=facetResults&t=response) above) using a prefix. If you want to filter the [`buckets`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!c=200&path=facetResults/buckets&t=response) of a particular [`sourceName`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!c=200&path=facetResults/buckets&t=response) in the [`facetResults`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!c=200&path=facetResults&t=response) using a specific prefix, you can set the [`facetBucketFilter`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!path=requestOptions/facetBucketFilter&t=request) object. It has the following two fields:

1. [`facet`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!path=requestOptions/facetBucketFilter/facet&t=request) - The facet fieldName that you want to filter on.
2. [`prefix`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!path=requestOptions/facetBucketFilter/prefix&t=request) - The prefix by which you want to filter the buckets of that facet by.

To use this Facet Bucket Filtering make sure that the [`responseHints`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!path=requestOptions/responseHints&t=request) field under [`requestOptions`](https://developers.glean.com/client/operation/search/#tag/Search/operation/search!path=requestOptions&t=request) contains "FACET_RESULTS" . See the sample request body below that filters the "type" bucket using the prefix “co”:

```json
{
  "query": "test",
  "requestOptions": {
    "facetBucketFilter": {
      "facet": "type",
      "prefix": "co"
    },
    "facetBucketSize": 3000,
    "responseHints": ["FACET_RESULTS"]
  }
}
```

Within the `facetResults` field in the response to this query, you will find that the bucket for `sourceName`="type" contains only those values with the prefix "co" in any word.

You can limit the maximum number of buckets you get within the `facetResults` for all `sourceName` by passing your desired value into `facetBucketSize`. In the example above, we limit buckets to 3000

### Preferred Name prefix matching

For `sourceName` supporting people within the buckets (e.g., "from", "owner", etc.), we support prefix matching using their preferred names (or nicknames). So if `facetBucketFilter` is applied to the “from” facet using the prefix “Adi,” it will give all the people whose either name or preferred name has a prefix of “Adi”.
