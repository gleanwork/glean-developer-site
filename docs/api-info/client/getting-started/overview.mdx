- **Analytics Dashboards**: Build custom analytics and reporting tools using Glean's insights and activity data
- **Workflow Integration**: Embed search and AI capabilities into existing business applications

## Developer Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Authentication Setup">
Choose your authentication method based on your use case:
- **OAuth** (recommended): Best for user-facing applications requiring user permissions
- **Glean Tokens**: Suitable for server-to-server integrations or when OAuth isn't available

See our [Authentication Setup Guide](../authentication/overview) for detailed instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Your Approach">
Select your development approach:
- **Official SDKs**: Use our [Python, Java, NodeJS, or Go SDKs](../../../libraries/api-clients) for faster development
- **Direct REST API**: Make HTTP requests directly for maximum flexibility
- **Web SDK**: Embed pre-built UI components using our [Web SDK](../../../libraries/web-sdk/overview)
</Step>

<Step title="Start Building">
Begin with core functionality using our [Basic Usage Guide](basic-usage):
- Try basic search queries to understand result formats
- Experiment with chat endpoints for conversational features  
- Test document retrieval and permission handling
- Explore content creation endpoints (collections, answers)
</Step>

<Step title="Production Considerations">
Prepare for production deployment:
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Set up monitoring and logging for API usage
- Review [rate limits](../../../get-started/rate-limits) and plan scaling
- Test permission scenarios thoroughly
</Step>
</Steps>
