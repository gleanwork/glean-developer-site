## Core APIs

### Chat API - Conversational AI

Ask questions and get AI-powered answers grounded in your organization's knowledge.

**Request Format:**
```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/chat \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "author": "USER",
        "fragments": [
          { "text": "What is our vacation policy?" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Response Structure:**
```json showLineNumbers
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "messageType": "CONTENT", 
      "author": "GLEAN_AI",
      "fragments": [
        {
          "text": "Based on our employee handbook, the vacation policy allows..."
        },
        {
          "citation": {
            "sourceDocument": {
              "title": "Employee Handbook 2024",
              "url": "https://company.com/handbook",
              "snippet": "Employees accrue 15 days of PTO annually..."
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "chatId": "chat_abc123",
  "followUpPrompts": [
    "What are the paid time off policies?",
    "How do I request vacation time?"
  ],
  "backendTimeMillis": 1200,
  "chatSessionTrackingToken": "session_xyz789"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Fragments**: Mix of text content and citations in responses
- **Chat ID**: Use `chatId` for follow-up messages in the same conversation  
- **Citations**: Source documents that informed the AI's response (inline in fragments)
- **Follow-up Prompts**: Suggested questions based on the response context
- **Tracking Tokens**: For analytics and feedback reporting
- **Streaming**: Set `"stream": true` for real-time response chunks
- **Multi-turn**: Include previous messages for conversational context

### Search API - Enterprise Search

Find documents, people, and information across all connected systems.

**Request Format:**
```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/search \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "quarterly planning",
    "pageSize": 10,
    "requestOptions": {
      "datasourcesFilter": ["confluence", "gdrive"],
      "facetBucketSize": 100
    }
  }'
```

**Response Structure:**
```json showLineNumbers
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "doc_123",
      "title": "Q4 Planning Document", 
      "url": "https://company.com/q4-plan",
      "snippet": "Our Q4 objectives focus on...",
      "datasource": "confluence",
      "lastModified": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "permissions": {
        "canView": true,
        "canEdit": false
      },
      "author": {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "email": "jane@company.com"
      }
    }
  ],
  "facets": {
    "datasource": [
      { "value": "confluence", "count": 15 },
      { "value": "gdrive", "count": 8 }
    ],
    "author": [
      { "value": "Jane Smith", "count": 3 }
    ]
  },
  "requestId": "req_abc123"
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Results**: Array of documents with rich metadata
- **Facets**: Aggregations for filtering and navigation (e.g., by datasource, author)
- **Permissions**: User-specific access controls (canView, canEdit)
- **Filters**: Narrow results by datasource, author, date, etc.
- **Ranking**: Results ordered by relevance scoring

### Agents API - Pre-built Workflows

Execute specialized AI agents built in Glean's Agent Builder for complex workflows.

**Request Format:**
```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/agents/runs/wait \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "input": {
      "query": "Analyze our Q4 sales performance",
      "region": "North America",
      "timeframe": "Q4 2023"
    }
  }'
```

**Response Structure:**
```json showLineNumbers
{
  "run": {
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "input": {
      "query": "Analyze our Q4 sales performance",
      "region": "North America",
      "timeframe": "Q4 2023"
    },
    "status": "success"
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "GLEAN_AI",
      "content": [
        {
          "text": "Based on the Q4 sales data, I found that sales increased 15% compared to Q3...",
          "type": "text"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Agent ID**: Unique identifier for pre-built agents in Agent Builder
- **Input vs Messages**: Use `input` object for data OR `messages` array for conversation
- **Run Status**: "success" or "error" indicating execution result
- **Response Messages**: Agent responses in message format with role and content
- **Wait vs Stream**: Use `/runs/wait` for complete response or `/runs/stream` for real-time

## Common Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Content Discovery

Use search to help users discover and navigate to specific documents:

<Steps>
<Step title="Initial Discovery Search">
Start with a broad search to find relevant content:

```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/search \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "employee onboarding",
    "pageSize": 10,
    "requestOptions": {
      "facetBucketSize": 100
    }
  }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Present Results with Navigation">
Show users the search results with links to actual documents, plus facets for further filtering:

- Display document titles, snippets, and direct links
- Show facet counts (e.g., "Confluence (15)", "Google Drive (8)")
- Allow users to click through to read full documents
</Step>

<Step title="Follow-up Questions">
Once users have context from reading documents, they can ask specific questions via chat:

```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/chat \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "author": "USER",
        "fragments": [
          { "text": "What are the steps for setting up a new employee'\''s laptop?" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Pattern 2: Progressive Conversations

Build multi-turn conversations that maintain context:

```bash showLineNumbers
# First message
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/chat \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "author": "USER",
        "fragments": [{ "text": "What are our company'\''s main products?" }]
      }
    ]
  }'

# Follow-up using chatId
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/chat \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "chatId": "chat_abc123",
    "messages": [
      {
        "author": "USER", 
        "fragments": [{ "text": "What are our company'\''s main products?" }]
      },
      {
        "author": "GLEAN_AI",
        "fragments": [{ "text": "Our main products include..." }]
      },
      {
        "author": "USER",
        "fragments": [{ "text": "Which one generates the most revenue?" }]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Pattern 3: Faceted Search Navigation

Use facets to help users navigate and filter results:

<Steps>
<Step title="Initial Search">
Start with a broad search to understand available content:

```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/search \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "project planning",
    "pageSize": 10,
    "requestOptions": {
      "facetBucketSize": 100
    }
  }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Show Facets">
Display facet counts to users (e.g., "Confluence (15)", "Google Drive (8)")
</Step>

<Step title="Filtered Search">
Let users click facets to refine results:

```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/search \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "project planning",
    "pageSize": 10,
    "requestOptions": {
      "datasourcesFilter": ["confluence"],
      "facetFilters": [
        {
          "fieldName": "author",
          "values": ["Jane Smith"]
        }
      ],
      "facetBucketSize": 100
    }
  }'
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Pattern 4: Streaming for Real-time UX

Use streaming for interactive chat experiences:

```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST https://your-instance-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/chat \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [
      {
        "author": "USER",
        "fragments": [{ "text": "Explain our Q4 strategy" }]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Handle the streaming response to show text as it arrives, creating a more engaging user experience.
