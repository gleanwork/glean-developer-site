We allow the option of allowing developers to push activity information for documents (VIEW, EDIT etc.) - that will be used for better ranking of documents for search.

## Getting started with the activity endpoint

First note that, the [activity endpoint](/api/client-api/activity/activity) needs to be called with a **client API** bearer token (as opposed to an indexing API bearer token for other endpoints). This is because, we expect activity to be provided server-to-server on a per-user basis (eg. when a user views a document from a custom datasource, you may report this view back to us from your server).

For pushing activity for any user from your organization, we need a _Global_ client API token scoped to _ACTIVITY_.

To fetch a scoped client API token, please follow the instructions in the [Authentication page for Client API](/api-info/client/authentication/glean-issued#available-scopes).

### Making your first request

Below is a sample activity request for a given user (who needs to be specified in the **X-Glean-ActAs** param).

We record 2 view events: One for https://example.com/doc1 and another for https://example.com/doc2. We specify the datasource in the params field (so it is correctly matched to the relevant document) and optionally, we also mention the duration of the view if available.

```bash cURL
curl -i -X POST \
  'https://customer-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1/activity' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Glean-ActAs: user-whose-activity-is-being-reported@example.com' \
  -d '{
    "events": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/doc1",
        "action": "VIEW",
        "timestamp": "2023-04-05T04:56:07.000Z"
        "params": {
            "datasource": "testdatasource"
        }
      },
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/doc2",
        "action": "VIEW",
        "timestamp": "2023-04-04T04:56:07.000Z",
        "params": {
          "duration": 20,
          "referrer": "https://example.com/document"
          "datasource": "testdatasource2"
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```
