The bulk upload endpoints delete all entries that are not a part of the most recent upload. For example, `/bulkindexdocuments` endpoint would delete all the documents that are not present in the most recent upload.

Concurrent uploads are not allowed ie. you cannot start a new upload before the previous upload is finished.

There are some fields that are common across all bulk upload endpoints. We will be describing them here:

| Field Name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `uploadId`                          | This is the id which uniquely identifies an upload. You need to have a unique uploadId for all the paginated requests you send for an upload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `isFirstPage`                       | This denotes whether the page being uploaded is the first page, and needs to be true for the first request and false for all subsequent requests for an upload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `isLastPage`                        | This denotes whether the page being uploaded is the last page, and needs to be true for the last request and false for all other requests for an upload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `forceRestartUpload`                | This is required if you want to start a new upload but the previous upload has not finished or has failed. Not specifying this bit in case of an unsuccessful previous upload will fail the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `disableStaleDocumentDeletionCheck` | The `/bulkindexdocuments` asynchronously deletes all documents that werenâ€™t a part of the most recent upload session. This can lead to accidental situations where too many documents get wiped in case of an erroneous bulk upload.<br/><br/>To mitigate this, we have a deletion check in place which pauses the deletion of stale documents for 7 days if the percentage of docs being deleted exceeds 20%. <br/><br/>In case you intentionally want to delete more than 20% of your previously uploaded documents, you can specify `disableStaleDocumentDeletionCheck = true`, which disables this check and allows the documents to be deleted. Note that documensts are delete asynchronously. <br/><br/>If you wish for deletions to take effect immediately, use `/processalldocuments` endpoint. |
