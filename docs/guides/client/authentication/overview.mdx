The developer-ready Client API endpoints can be accessed via one of two types of Bearer tokens: [OAuth Access Tokens](/client/authentication/oauth) issued by an SSO provider or [Glean-issued tokens](#glean-issued-tokens). Both methods can be used concurrently, but we recommend using OAuth access tokens for a more secure authentication for Client API requests, scoped to the individual user it's issued to.

## Navigating to Client API Settings

Only admins have access to these settings. To access it, navigate to [this link](https://app.glean.com/admin/platform/tokenManagement?tab=client), or do the following:

1. Click on the wrench icon in the left navigation bar. This will open up the admin console.
2. On the left sidebar, navigate to **Platform** and select **API Tokens**.
3. In the API Tokens page, select the **Client Tokens** tab. Here you can see a list of all token metadata (note that the token itself won't be visible).
