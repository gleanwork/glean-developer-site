# Actions FAQ

## Common Questions

<details>
<summary>Which fields are interpreted by LLM?</summary>

The "Unique Identifier" and "Trigger Condition (including Example Queries)" fields are used by the LLM to identify which action it should invoke/use for a user's query.

Make sure to give a detailed trigger condition and example queries, to ensure LLM knows exactly what user queries this action should be used for.

<summary>What are type hints?</summary>

Type hints are like instructions that help the Glean AI understand and work with different actions better. They're clues that tell the AI what each part of an action does, making it easier for the AI to get the right information or do the right thing with those actions.

### Benefits of Implementing Type Hints

Type hints provide two key advantages:

- **Simplified Action Creation**: Type hints make it easier for developers to describe their actions' capabilities and requirements.
- **Better at Getting Information and Doing Tasks**: Type hints give clear instructions on gathering data or performing actions, leading to more accurate and relevant results from the AI.

### How to Use Type Hints

To use type-hints, consider the following steps:

1. Identify Relevant Type Hints: Review the list of supported type hints to determine which ones align with your action's functionality.
2. Incorporate Type Hints into Your API Specs: Add the selected type hints as structured details in your action's API specifications.

<details>
<summary>How much data can my service return (for retrieval actions)?</summary>

The response from the service you're connecting to retrieve content using your retrieval action will be sent to the LLM to create the final response. Hence, please ensure that the data returned is not larger than ~8000 characters. Depending on the LLM model being used, larger responses will be truncated from the end.
