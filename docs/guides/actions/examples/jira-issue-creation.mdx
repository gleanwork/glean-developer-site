# Jira Issue Creation

## Overview

This guide explains how to create an execution action that allows Glean Assistant to create Jira issues on behalf of users. The implementation uses OAuth-based authentication and ensures proper user attribution for created issues.

This is an **execution action** that performs operations directly by making API calls to Jira through a custom server implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this implementation, ensure you have:

- Administrator access to your Jira and Glean instances
- Familiarity with OAuth 2.0 authentication flows
- Basic understanding of API implementation
- Access to necessary development resources

## Implementation Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Action Manifest Configuration">
    <p>The first step involves creating an action manifest that defines the core properties of your Jira integration. This manifest establishes the fundamental characteristics and authentication requirements of your action.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Click to expand the action manifest configuration</summary>

    ```json
    {
      "type": "ACTION",
      "name": "CreateJiraIssue",
      "displayName": "Create Jira Issue Action",
      "description": "This action allows you to create a new issue in Jira. You can specify the project, issue type, and other details.",
      "enablePreview": true,
      "actionType": "EXECUTION",
      "logoUrl": "path/to/your/logo.png",
      "auth": {
        "type": "OAUTH_ADMIN",
        "client_url": "https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize?audience={ATLASSIAN-DOMAIN}.atlassian.net&prompt=consent",
        "scopes": ["write:jira-work", "offline_access", "read:me"],
        "authorization_url": "https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token"
      }
    }
    ```

    </details>

    <p>We use the <code>OAUTH_ADMIN</code> authentication type because Jira's cloud API supports using admin tokens to create issues on behalf of other users. This approach simplifies the authentication flow while maintaining proper user attribution.</p>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Server Implementation">
    <p>The server implementation handles requests from Glean's actions backend and manages the creation of Jira issues. This implementation includes proper security measures and ensures accurate user attribution.</p>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Testing and Deployment">
    <p>After configuration, thoroughly test the action before deployment.</p>

    <h4>Testing Process</h4>
    
    1. Deploy your server implementation to a publicly accessible endpoint
    2. Configure the action in Glean with your server URL
    3. Test with various user email addresses to verify user attribution
    4. Validate that issues are created with correct project, type, and assignee information
    5. Test error scenarios (invalid users, missing permissions, etc.)

    <h4>Deployment Configuration</h4>
    <p>Once testing is complete, deploy the action to your organization with appropriate access controls.</p>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Security and Authentication

<Card title="OAuth Configuration" icon="Shield">
  The implementation incorporates several security measures that protect your Jira integration:

  - The OAuth configuration uses admin-level authentication, which provides centralized control while maintaining individual user attribution
  - The server implementation validates all incoming requests and enforces proper user attribution
  - The `Glean-User-Email` header ensures that issues are created with the correct reporter, maintaining accountability and traceability
</Card>

### User Attribution System

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Email Mapping" icon="UserCheck">
    The server retrieves the appropriate Jira account ID for each user by matching their email address:

    - This process ensures that issues appear in Jira with the correct reporter
    - Maintains accurate audit trails and user accountability
    - Handles cases where users might not be found in Jira
  </Card>

  <Card title="Data Integrity" icon="Database">
    The implementation prevents issues from being created without proper attribution:

    - Safeguards maintain data integrity within your Jira instance
    - Error handling for missing or invalid user information
    - Proper validation of all required fields
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Performance Optimization

<Card title="Efficient Implementation" icon="Zap">
  Several measures ensure optimal performance of the Jira integration:

  - Uses efficient user lookup mechanisms with pagination for large organizations
  - Includes proper request timeouts and connection pooling
  - API specification includes type hints that help Glean Assistant populate fields correctly
  - Reduces the need for repeated attempts or corrections
</Card>

### Error Handling

<Card title="Comprehensive Error Management" icon="AlertTriangle">
  The implementation includes comprehensive error handling that addresses common scenarios:

  - Authentication failures receive appropriate error responses with clear messages
  - Missing or invalid user information is caught and handled gracefully  
  - Jira API errors are properly captured and communicated back to users
  - Network issues and timeouts are managed appropriately
</Card>

## Testing & Validation

<Card title="Comprehensive Testing" icon="Beaker">
  Implement thorough testing across these scenarios:

  - Different user types and permission levels
  - Various project and issue type combinations
  - Edge cases in user email mapping
  - Authentication failure scenarios
  - Network connectivity issues
</Card>

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

:::warning
Watch out for these common implementation mistakes:

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify OAuth token validity
   - Check scope configurations
   - Confirm user permissions

2. **User Attribution Problems**
   - Verify email mapping functionality
   - Check Jira user account status
   - Confirm proper header parsing

3. **Performance Concerns**
   - Monitor response times
   - Check rate limit usage
   - Review connection pooling settings
:::

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or execution:

1. **Verify Authentication Configuration**
   - Check OAuth credentials are correctly configured
   - Ensure proper scopes are granted
   - Validate server endpoint accessibility

2. **Debug User Attribution**
   - Verify email mapping functionality
   - Check Jira user account status
   - Confirm proper header parsing and validation

3. **Test API Integration**
   - Monitor response times and error rates
   - Check rate limit usage against Jira limits
   - Review connection pooling and timeout settings

## Next Steps

After implementing the Jira integration:

- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive user documentation
- **Monitoring**: Establish monitoring and alerting systems  
- **Schedules**: Set up regular maintenance schedules
- **Enhancements**: Plan for feature enhancements
- **Recovery**: Configure backup and recovery procedures
