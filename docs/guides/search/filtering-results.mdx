Filters are a powerful tool to narrow down your search results. We support filters that are generalized to every document, as well as filters that are specific to different datasources.

This guide will focus on our general filters and how to utilize them.

## How to Use

In order to filter search results to show documents that match certain fields via the [/search REST API](/api/client-api/search/overview), you need to construct a list of `facetFilter` objects and pass it into the [`requestOptions`](/api/client-api/search/search#request-requestoptions) object.

Each facetFilter object has the following relevant fields:

| Field Name  | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fieldName` | the name of the field we are filtering by (eg “from” to facet by user, “type” for document type, etc). fieldName should be unique in the list of facetFilter objects. |
| `values`    | a list of facetFilterValue objects. All values are OR’d between the same field name (we AND between different field names).                                           |

A facetFilterValue object has the following relevant fields:

| Field Name     | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `value`        | string value that results are being filtered to. |
| `relationType` | can take on the values below:                    |

### Basic Example

To filter to only the document type pdf search results, you would send the following in the facetFilter field. This is the equivalent of adding “type:pdf” to your search query.

```json
[
  {
    "fieldName": "type",
    "values": [
      {
        "relationType": "EQUALS",
        "value": "pdf"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Exceptions to the basic example

### Time filters

Time filters are the only exception to the rule. The `fieldName` is always “last_updated_at”, and we use different relationTypes to specify different time ranges.

We support 2 types of values: specific dates and special values.

#### Specific dates

Use the “GT” and “LT” `relationTypes` to specify a date range. The ranges can also be open-ended (only include a GT or an LT). Each date value should be in the form `YYYY-MM-DD` passed in as a string. Note that when using GT and LT, the values are noninclusive (eg using \{`relationType`=”GT”, value=”2023-06-17”\} will include dates from 2023-06-18 and later).

All dates provided will begin with the “start of the day” (12:00 am). Dates will end at the end of the day (11:59:59 pm).

Closed date range example for filtering to documents from dates 6/16, 6/17, 6/18, 6/19:

```json
[
  {
    "fieldName": "last_updated_at",
    "values": [
      {
        "relationType": "GT",
        "value": "2023-06-15"
      },
      {
        "relationType": "LT",
        "value": "2023-06-20"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Open date range example for filtering to documents from dates 6/11 onwards:

```json
[
  {
    "fieldName": "last_updated_at",
    "values": [
      {
        "relationType": "GT",
        "value": "2023-06-10"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Special Values

For special values, we allow the values `past_day, past_week, past_month, yesterday, today, past_n_days, past_n_weeks, past_n_months, past_n_years `for the relation type `EQUALS`, where n is a number, ie 5 in `past_5_days`. For all past* prefixed values, we also support the last* prefix, they mean the same thing (ie `last_week` is a viable substitute for `past_week`).

We allow the values `past_day, past_week, past_month, yesterday,today `for the relation type `LT`.

We allow the values `yesterday `for the relation type `GT`.

If you pass in an invalid special value, you will get an 422 error letting you know you have an invalid operator. Invalid special values for time filters are the only case in which a 422 error is returned.

If you are used to using operators and values in the query string, here are some examples of translations of query string value to REST API value.

Sample:

`updated:today` becomes

```json
[
  {
    "fieldName": "last_updated_at",
    "values": [{ "relationType": "EQUALS", "value": "today" }]
  }
]
```

`before:past_week` becomes

```json
[
  {
    "fieldName": "last_updated_at",
    "values": [{ "relationType": "LT", "value": "past_week" }]
  }
]
```

`after:yesterday` becomes

```json
[
  {
    "fieldName": "last_updated_at",
    "values": [{ "relationType": "GT", "value": "yesterday" }]
  }
]
```

#### Timezone considerations

We factor in user’s timezone for all queries except when you use the value `past_week`, `past_year`, `past_month` and `past_day` with the relationType `EQUALS`. (these are handled by built-in elastic date aggregation that doesn’t account for timezone).

### History filter

`my:` facet will only ever have the value “history”. It filters to show only documents the user has viewed before. The object always looks like this:

```json
{
  "fieldName": "suggested",
  "groupName": "",
  "values": [{ "relationType": "EQUALS", "value": "my history" }]
}
```

### From filter (or any user filter):

If you would like to specify a specific user, for example, if there are 2 people with the same name, “User one”, you can specify which one you mean by using the email address they authenticated with Glean as the `value` . IE user[at]glean.com and userone[at]glean.com would facet by different “User One”s even if they have the same name.

Sample query:

```json
from:"User one" updated:today type:document
requestOptions.facetFilters:
[{ "fieldName": "from",
    "values": [ {
        "relationType": "EQUALS",
        "value": "userone@glean.com"
      }] },
  {
    "fieldName": "last_updated_at",
    "values": [{
        "relationType": "EQUALS",
        "value": "today"
      }] },
  {
    "fieldName": "type",
    "values": [{
        "relationType": "EQUALS",
        "value": "document"
      }]}
]
```
