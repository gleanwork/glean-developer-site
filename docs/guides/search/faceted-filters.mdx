We provide the functionality of filtering the list of possible facets of a particular type (obtained in the [`facetResults`](/api/client-api/search/search#response-facetresults) above) using a prefix. If you want to filter the [`buckets`](/api/client-api/search/search#response-facetresults-buckets) of a particular [`sourceName`](/api/client-api/search/search#response-facetresults-sourcename) in the [`facetResults`](/api/client-api/search/search#response-facetresults) using a specific prefix, you can set the [`facetBucketFilter`](/api/client-api/search/search#request-requestoptions-facetbucketfilter) object. It has the following two fields:

1. [`facet`](/api/client-api/search/search#request-requestoptions-facetbucketfilter-facet) - The facet fieldName that you want to filter on.
2. [`prefix`](/api/client-api/search/search#request-requestoptions-facetbucketfilter-prefix) - The prefix by which you want to filter the buckets of that facet by.

To use this Facet Bucket Filtering make sure that the [`responseHints`](/api/client-api/search/search#request-requestoptions-responsehints) contains "FACET_RESULTS" . See the sample request body below that filters the "type" bucket using the prefix “co”:

```json
{
  "query": "test",
  "requestOptions": {
    "facetBucketFilter": {
      "facet": "type",
      "prefix": "co"
    },
    "facetBucketSize": 3000,
    "responseHints": ["FACET_RESULTS"]
  }
}
```

Within the `facetResults` field in the response to this query, you will find that the bucket for `sourceName`="type" contains only those values with the prefix "co" in any word.

You can limit the maximum number of buckets you get within the `facetResults` for all `sourceName` by passing your desired value into `facetBucketSize`. In the example above, we limit buckets to 3000

### Preferred Name prefix matching

For `sourceName` supporting people within the buckets (e.g., "from", "owner", etc.), we support prefix matching using their preferred names (or nicknames). So if `facetBucketFilter` is applied to the “from” facet using the prefix “Adi,” it will give all the people whose either name or preferred name has a prefix of “Adi”.
