## Common Use Cases

### Customer Support Chatbot
Build a chatbot that can answer customer questions using your help documentation, FAQs, and knowledge base.

### Internal Knowledge Assistant
Create an internal tool that helps employees find company policies, procedures, and documentation.

### Developer Assistant
Build a coding assistant that can search through your codebase, documentation, and best practices.

### Sales Enablement Tool
Develop a tool that helps sales teams find relevant case studies, product information, and competitive intelligence.

## Architecture Patterns

### Simple Request-Response
For basic Q&A scenarios where each query is independent.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Chat API]
    B --> C[AI Response]
    C --> D[User]
```

### Conversational with Memory
For multi-turn conversations that maintain context.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Add to History]
    B --> C[Chat API with Context]
    C --> D[AI Response]
    D --> E[Update History]
    E --> F[User]
```

### RAG Pattern
For responses that need specific document context.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Search API]
    B --> C[Relevant Documents]
    C --> D[Chat API with Context]
    D --> E[AI Response]
    E --> F[User]
```

## Best Practices

### Message Structure
- Use clear, specific queries for better results
- Include relevant context in system messages
- Structure conversations with proper message types

### Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
- Provide fallback responses for API errors

### Performance Optimization
- Use streaming for real-time responses
- Implement caching for frequently asked questions
- Optimize message history length

### Security Considerations
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper authentication
- Respect user permissions and data access
