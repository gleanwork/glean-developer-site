## Which Approach Should I Use?

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

| Factor | Local MCP Server | Remote MCP Server |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Availability** | âœ… Available now | ðŸ”’ Private beta - contact Glean team |
| **Setup** | Install & configure locally | No setup required |
| **Maintenance** | You manage updates & hosting | Glean manages everything |
| **Security** | Runs on your infrastructure | Enterprise-grade Glean infrastructure |
| **Performance** | Depends on your local setup | Enterprise SLA with guaranteed uptime |
| **Ideal For** | Developers, quick testing, full control | Enterprise deployments, production use |

:::tip Quick Start Recommendation
If you're just getting started or want to test MCP integration, begin with the Local MCP Server. You can always migrate to the Remote MCP Server when it becomes generally available.

## Local MCP Server (Available Now)

The Local MCP Server is a self-hosted solution that you install and run on your own infrastructure. This gives you full control over the setup and allows immediate access to Glean's MCP capabilities.

  Official local MCP server implementation for Glean's search and chat capabilities
</Card>

### Features

- **Enterprise Search**: Access Glean's powerful content search capabilities
- **Chat Interface**: Interact with Glean's AI assistant
- **MCP Compliant**: Implements the Model Context Protocol specification
- **Cross-Platform**: Works with Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and more
- **Easy Setup**: Simple CLI configuration for popular MCP clients

### Available Tools

The Glean MCP server provides the following tools:

#### `company_search`

Search Glean's content index using the Glean Search API. This tool allows you to query Glean's content index with various filtering and configuration options.

#### `chat`

Interact with Glean's AI assistant using the Glean Chat API. This tool allows you to have conversational interactions with Glean's AI, including support for message history, citations, and various configuration options.

#### `people_profile_search`

Search Glean's People directory to find employee information.

### Configuration

#### API Tokens

You'll need Glean [API credentials](/get-started/authentication), and specifically a [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/overview). API Tokens require the following scopes: `chat`, `search`. You should speak to your Glean administrator to provision these tokens.

:::warning
Currently, our MCP implementation uses API tokens for authentication. While the MCP specification includes [optional authorization mechanisms](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/) and there is [an active RFC to add OAuth 2.0 support](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/133), we're using a simple token-based approach for now. Once the OAuth specification is finalized and widely adopted in the MCP ecosystem, we plan to implement OAuth-based authentication for enhanced security and user management.

### Configure Cursor

  <TabItem value="configure-using-the-cli" label="Configure using the CLI">

    <Steps>
          <Step title="Get Credentials">
            Ensure you have your Glean API credentials ready from the [Configuration](#configuration) section above. You'll need:
            - Your Glean instance name
            - A [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/overview)
          </Step>

          <Step title="Configure Cursor">
            Run the following command to configure Cursor to use Glean's MCP server. This will add a new MCP server to Cursor's settings.

            Using explicit `domain` and `token` flags:
            ```bash
            npx @gleanwork/mcp-server configure --client cursor --instance <your-glean-instance-name> --token <your-glean-api-token>
            ```

            Using a `.env` file:
            ```bash

            Since MCP [does not mandate a specific tool discovery interface](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools/), you may need to explicitly prompt Cursor's AI to use Glean's tools. Try prefixing your questions with phrases like "Using Glean, ..." or "Search in Glean for ..." to help the AI understand which tool to use.

            1. Open a new chat in Cursor

      <Step title="Get Credentials">
        Ensure you have your Glean API credentials ready from the [Configuration](#configuration) section above. You'll need:
        - Your Glean instance name
        - A [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/overview)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
        Run the following command to configure Claude Desktop to use Glean's MCP server. This will add a new MCP server to Claude Desktop's settings.

        Using explicit `domain` and `token` flags:
        ```bash
        npx @gleanwork/mcp-server configure --client claude --instance <your-glean-instance-name> --token <your-glean-api-token>
        ```

        Using a `.env` file:
        ```bash
        npx @gleanwork/mcp-server configure --client claude --env <path-to-env-file>
        ```
      </Step>

          Since MCP [does not mandate a specific tool discovery interface](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools/), you may need to explicitly prompt Claude to use Glean's tools. Try prefixing your questions with phrases like "Using Glean, ..." or "Search in Glean for ..." to help Claude understand which tool to use.

## Remote MCP Server (Private Beta)

The Remote MCP Server is built directly into Glean's platform, providing enterprise-grade hosting, security, and performance without requiring any local setup or maintenance.

:::info Private Beta Status
The Remote MCP Server is currently in private beta. It's available to select enterprise customers and requires special access from the Glean team.
:::

### Key Benefits

- **Zero Setup**: No installation, configuration, or maintenance required
- **Enterprise Security**: Built on Glean's secure, SOC 2 compliant infrastructure
- **High Performance**: Enterprise SLA with guaranteed uptime and response times
- **Automatic Updates**: Always running the latest features and security patches
- **Centralized Management**: IT teams can manage access and permissions centrally
- **Scalable**: Handles enterprise-scale workloads without performance degradation

### How It Works

The Remote MCP Server operates as a cloud service within Glean's infrastructure:

1. **Direct Integration**: MCP clients connect directly to Glean's hosted endpoints
2. **Authentication**: Uses your existing Glean authentication and permissions
3. **Real-time Access**: Provides live access to your organization's knowledge base
4. **Audit & Compliance**: Full audit logging and compliance reporting available

### Same Tools, Better Experience

The Remote MCP Server provides the same powerful tools as the Local MCP Server:
