# <MCPIcon className="inline" height="1.4rem" /> Glean MCP Integration

Glean's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables AI models to securely access and search your organization's knowledge. This integration allows you to use Glean's powerful search and chat capabilities in MCP-compatible tools and applications.

<Note>
  This documentation is for the STDIO (local) MCP server implementation. For the
  Remote MCP server implementation, please reach out to your Glean account team.

  <br />
  Official STDIO (local) MCP server implementation for Glean's search and chat
  capabilities
</Card>

## Features

- **Enterprise Search**: Access Glean's powerful content search capabilities
- **Chat Interface**: Interact with Glean's AI assistant
- **MCP Compliant**: Implements the Model Context Protocol specification

## Available Tools

The Glean MCP server provides the following tools:

### `company_search`

Search Glean's content index using the Glean Search API. This tool allows you to query Glean's content index with various filtering and configuration options.

### `chat`

Interact with Glean's AI assistant using the Glean Chat API. This tool allows you to have conversational interactions with Glean's AI, including support for message history, citations, and various configuration options.

### `people_profile_search`

Search Glean's People directory to find employee information.

## Configuration

### API Tokens

You'll need Glean [API credentials](/get-started/authentication), and specifically a [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/glean-issued#available-scopes). API Tokens require the following scopes: `chat`, `search`. You should speak to your Glean administrator to provision these tokens.

<Warning>
  Currently, our MCP implementation uses API tokens for authentication. While
  the MCP specification includes [optional authorization
  mechanisms](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/)
  and there is [an active RFC to add OAuth 2.0
  support](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/133),
  we're using a simple token-based approach for now. Once the OAuth
  specification is finalized and widely adopted in the MCP ecosystem, we plan to
  implement OAuth-based authentication for enhanced security and user
  management.

    <Steps>
          <Step title="Get Credentials">
            Ensure you have your Glean API credentials ready from the [Configuration](#configuration) section above. You'll need:
            - Your Glean instance name
            - A [user-scoped API token](/client/authentication#user)
          </Step>

          <Step title="Configure Cursor">
            Run the following command to configure Cursor to use Glean's MCP server. This will add a new MCP server to Cursor's settings.

            Using explicit `domain` and `token` flags:
            ```bash
            npx @gleanwork/mcp-server configure --client cursor --instance <your-glean-instance-name> --token <your-glean-api-token>
            ```

            Using a `.env` file:
            ```bash

              Since MCP [does not mandate a specific tool discovery interface](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools/), you may need to explicitly prompt Cursor's AI to use Glean's tools. Try prefixing your questions with phrases like "Using Glean, ..." or "Search in Glean for ..." to help the AI understand which tool to use.
            </Note>

            1. Open a new chat in Cursor
            2. Try a query like "Using Glean, what's our company's policy on remote work?"

      <Step title="Get Credentials">
        Ensure you have your Glean API credentials ready from the [Configuration](#configuration) section above. You'll need:
        - Your Glean instance name
        - A [user-scoped API token](/client/authentication#user)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
        1. Click "Claude" in the menu bar
        2. Select "Settings..."
        3. Click on "Developer"
        4. Click "Edit Config" to open your `claude_desktop_config.json` file
        5. Add the following configuration:

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "glean": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": ["-y", "@gleanwork/mcp-server"],
              "env": {
                "GLEAN_INSTANCE": "<your-glean-instance-name>",
                "GLEAN_API_TOKEN": "<your-glean-api-token>"
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        6. Save and close the file
        7. Restart Claude Desktop

        <Note>
        The config file is typically located at:
        - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
        - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
        </Note>

        Your MCP server should now be listed, as shown below.

        <Frame>
          <img src="./images/claude-mcp-settings.png" alt="Claude Desktop MCP Settings" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>


      <Step title="Test the Integration">
        <Note>
          Since MCP [does not mandate a specific tool discovery interface](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools/), you may need to explicitly prompt Claude to use Glean's tools. Try prefixing your questions with phrases like "Using Glean, ..." or "Search in Glean for ..." to help Claude understand which tool to use.
