### Key APIs for Agent Building

| API | Purpose | Use Case |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **[Agents API](/api/client-api/agents/overview)** | Manage and execute pre-built agents | Use agents created in Agent Builder |
| **[Chat API](/api/client-api/chat/overview)** | Conversational AI with context | Build chat-based agents |
| **[Search API](/api-info/client/search/filtering-results)** | Enterprise search capabilities | Retrieve relevant documents |
| **[Summarization API](/api/client-api/summarize/overview)** | AI-powered content summarization | Process and digest information |

### Example: Python Agent

```python
from glean.api_client import Glean
import os

class CustomAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = Glean(
            api_token=os.getenv("GLEAN_API_TOKEN"),
            instance=os.getenv("GLEAN_INSTANCE")
        )
    
    async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Search for relevant information
        search_response = await self.client.search.search({
            "query": query,
            "page_size": 5
        })
        
        # Step 2: Use chat API for reasoning
        chat_response = await self.client.chat.chat({
            "query": f"Based on these documents: {search_response.results}, answer: {query}",
            "stream": False
        })
        
        return chat_response.message

# Usage
agent = CustomAgent()
result = await agent.process_query("What is our vacation policy?")
```

## LangChain Integration

Leverage the rich Python ecosystem with our official LangChain integration. Perfect for developers already using LangChain or who want access to its extensive agent frameworks.

### When to Use
- Python-based development
- Existing LangChain workflows
- Rich ecosystem of tools and integrations
- Complex agent orchestration needs

</Card>

### Key Components

- **`GleanSearchRetriever`**: Retrieve documents from Glean
- **`GleanSearchTool`**: Agent tool for searching Glean
- **`GleanChatRetriever`**: Conversational retrieval with context

The integration provides everything you need to build production-ready agents with LangChain, including retrievers, tools, and chat capabilities. You can use it for simple RAG workflows, complex multi-agent systems, or anything in between.

## Glean Agent Toolkit

A Python toolkit that makes it easy to integrate Glean's powerful search and knowledge discovery capabilities into your AI agents. Use pre-built tools with popular agent frameworks or create your own custom tools that work across multiple platforms.

### When to Use
- Working with multiple agent frameworks (OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI, Google ADK)
- Need production-ready Glean tools (search, employee lookup, calendar, etc.)
- Want to define tools once and use across frameworks
- Building agents that require enterprise knowledge access

<Card 
  title="glean-agent-toolkit"
  icon="GitHub"
  href="https://github.com/gleanwork/glean-agent-toolkit"
>
  Official Python toolkit for adapting Glean's enterprise tools across multiple agent frameworks
</Card>

### Framework Support

The toolkit provides adapters for major agent frameworks:

| Framework | Installation | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **OpenAI Assistants** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[openai]` | Direct API integration with OpenAI |
| **LangChain** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[langchain]` | Rich Python agent ecosystem |
| **CrewAI** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[crewai]` | Multi-agent collaboration |
| **Google ADK** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[adk]` | Google's Agent Development Kit |

### Available Tools

The toolkit comes with production-ready tools that connect to Glean's capabilities:

- **`glean_search`**: Search your company's knowledge base
- **`employee_search`**: Find employees by name, team, department, or expertise
- **`calendar_search`**: Find meetings and calendar events
- **`code_search`**: Search your company's source code repositories
- **`gmail_search`**: Search Gmail messages and conversations
- **`outlook_search`**: Search Outlook mail and calendar items
- **`web_search`**: Search the public web for external information
- **`ai_web_search`**: Query Google Gemini for AI-powered web information

### Example: Multi-Framework Usage

```python
from glean.agent_toolkit.tools import glean_search, employee_search
import os

# Ensure environment variables are set
os.environ["GLEAN_API_TOKEN"] = "your-api-token"
os.environ["GLEAN_INSTANCE"] = "your-instance-name"

# Use with LangChain
langchain_search = glean_search.as_langchain_tool()
langchain_employees = employee_search.as_langchain_tool()

# Use with CrewAI
crewai_search = glean_search.as_crewai_tool()
crewai_employees = employee_search.as_crewai_tool()

# Use with OpenAI Assistants
openai_search = glean_search.as_openai_tool()
openai_employees = employee_search.as_openai_tool()
```

### Custom Tool Creation

Define your own tools once using the `@tool_spec` decorator and use them across any framework:

```python
from glean.agent_toolkit import tool_spec
from pydantic import BaseModel
import requests

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    temperature: float
    condition: str
    city: str

@tool_spec(
    name="get_current_weather",
    description="Get current weather information for a specified city",
    output_model=WeatherResponse
)
def get_weather(city: str, units: str = "celsius") -> WeatherResponse:
    """Fetch current weather for a city."""
    # Your implementation here
    return WeatherResponse(
        temperature=22.5,
        condition="sunny",
        city=city
    )

# Use across all supported frameworks
openai_weather = get_weather.as_openai_tool()
langchain_weather = get_weather.as_langchain_tool()
crewai_weather = get_weather.as_crewai_tool()
```

### Key Benefits

- **Framework Agnostic**: Write tools once, use everywhere
- **Production-Ready**: Pre-built tools for common Glean operations
- **Easy Integration**: Simple adapter pattern for different frameworks
- **Consistent API**: Same tool interface across all platforms
- **Enterprise Features**: Built-in support for Glean's enterprise capabilities

## Need a No-Code Solution?

For creating agents without writing code, use Glean's built-in Agent Builder:

<Card 
  title="Glean Agent Builder"
  icon="User"
  href="https://docs.glean.com/agents/home"
>
  Create agents with drag-and-drop interface, pre-built templates, and custom instructions. Perfect for business users and rapid prototyping.
</Card>

The Agent Builder provides a visual interface for creating agents directly in Glean. Agents created this way can still be accessed programmatically via the [Agents API](/api/client-api/agents/overview) for integration with your applications.

| Approach | Complexity | Flexibility | Time to Deploy | Best For |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Direct API** | High | Maximum | Medium | Custom integrations, multi-language |
| **LangChain** | Medium | High | Fast | Python ecosystem, rich tooling |
| **MCP** | Low | Medium | Fast | IDE integration, standardized tools |
| **Glean Agent Toolkit** | Medium | High | Medium | Cross-platform compatibility, multi-framework tools |

### Questions to Consider

1. **What's your technical background?**
   - Non-technical → [Agent Builder](https://docs.glean.com/agents/home)
   - Python developer → LangChain
   - Multi-language → Direct API

2. **Where will the agent run?**
   - IDE/Editor → MCP
   - Web application → Direct API
   - Multiple frameworks → Glean Agent Toolkit

3. **How much customization do you need?**
   - Simple Q&A → [Agent Builder](https://docs.glean.com/agents/home)
   - Complex workflows → Direct API

## Authentication & Setup

All approaches require Glean API credentials:

1. **Get API Token**: Request a [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/glean-issued#available-scopes)
2. **Required Scopes**: `chat`, `search`, `agents` (depending on usage)
3. **Environment Setup**: Configure your Glean instance and token
