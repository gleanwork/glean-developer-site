Choosing the appropriate type enables enhanced ranking. Please contact us if you
are unsure of how to categorize your datasource. If a datasource has multiple
objectTypes which belong to different categories (such as Zendesk articles and
Zendesk tickets), please set each category using `objectDefinitions.docCategory`.
The category definitions below still apply.
