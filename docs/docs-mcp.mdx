# Docs MCP Server

Give your AI coding assistant direct access to Glean's developer documentation. Query API references, explore integration guides, and find code examples without leaving your editor.

**Server URL:** `https://developers.glean.com/mcp`

## Available Tools

The Docs MCP server provides two tools to your AI assistant:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`docs_search`** | Search across the documentation index with relevance ranking. Returns page titles, URLs, and snippets. |
| **`docs_fetch`** | Retrieve the full content of any documentation page as markdown. Use URLs from search results or direct page links. |

## Usage Examples

Once connected, your AI assistant can answer questions about Glean's APIs:

- "What authentication methods does Glean support?"
- "How do I create a custom datasource with the Indexing API?"
- "Show me the Python SDK usage for the Chat API"
- "What are the required fields for indexing a document?"
