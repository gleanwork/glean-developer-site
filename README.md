# Glean Developer Site

The official developer documentation site for Glean. This site provides comprehensive documentation for Glean's APIs, SDKs, and developer tools.

## What's Inside

This documentation site includes:

- **API Reference**: Complete documentation for Glean's Client API and Indexing API
- **Getting Started Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials for new developers
- **API Client Documentation**: Libraries for Python, Java, Go, and TypeScript
- **Integration Guides**: Examples for popular frameworks and platforms
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Documentation for Glean's MCP implementation
- **Changelog**: Release notes and updates

## Prerequisites

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage tool versions. Install mise first, then run:

```bash
mise install
```

This will automatically install the correct versions of Node.js and pnpm as specified in `mise.toml`.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd glean-developer-site
pnpm install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8888`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm start` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build the site for production
- `pnpm serve` - Serve the built site locally
- `pnpm clear` - Clear Docusaurus cache

## Content Management

### Changelog Management

Use the pnpm command to create new changelog entries:

```bash
pnpm changelog:new
```

### OpenAPI Integration

The site automatically generates API documentation from OpenAPI specifications located in the `openapi/` directory.

## Environment Variables

The build optionally includes a Google verification meta tag. Set the
`GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` environment variable with your verification token if
you want this tag injected at build time:

```bash
export GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-token
pnpm build
```

If the variable is not set, the tag is omitted.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Run the build command to test for any issues:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will catch any broken links, missing imports, or other build-time errors.
